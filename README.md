# Doggo-connect

Doggo-connect is a web application that is meant to make the contact between possible adopters and dog shelters easier. 

During the sign up you have to specify if you are either an adopter or a shelter. This determines which dashboard you will see and which actions you can take after logging in. 

This was a group project where I mostly contributed to the design and the frontend using HTML, CSS, Handlebars, and some JavaScript. I also was responsible for some of the backend CRUD functionalities and routes in the adopter view.

### Which stack and tools?

For this project, we used HTML, CSS, Handlebars, Mapbox, and JavaScript for the front-end. We used NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB/Mongoose, Cloudinary, and Passport for the backend.

This was a group project so GitHub (pull requests, solving conflicts, merging, etcâ€¦)  played an important role in the development of it. 

### What needs to be improved?

The website was developed for google Chrome and uses flexbox gap which is not supported by some browsers like Safari. 
This version is not mobile responsive.
